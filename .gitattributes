# === Line Ending Settings ===
# Ensure consistent line endings across different operating systems.
# Text files will be normalized to the system's native line ending (CRLF on Windows, LF on others)
# when checked out. When committed, Git will attempt to normalize them to LF,
# unless specific overrides are given or core.autocrlf is set to 'true'.

# Auto detect text files and normalize them based on core.autocrlf setting.
* text=auto

# === Binary Files ===
# Declare specific files as binary to prevent Git from attempting line ending conversions
# or displaying diffs for them. This optimizes Git's performance and avoids corruption.

# === Git LFS (Large File Storage) Settings ===

# using Git LFS, uncomment and configure these lines.
